## Task 1 - Best Performing Student

1. Copy out the content of the `student-performance.py` file, and add a new function that returns the name of the best performing student
2. Write a function to generate a report showing details of the class statistics, student recognition, and individual student details highlight. Use the format available `save_report_to_file()` function in the `python-libraries-lesson.md` file
3. Save the generated report to a text file (.txt)


## Task 2  - Student Statistics Dashboard

Create a "Student Statistics Dashboard" that:

1. Loads student data from a CSV file
2. Calculates key statistics using the statistics module
3. Shows when the data was last updated using datetime
4. Includes a "student of the day" feature using random
5. Times how long the analysis takes using the time library
6. Rounds and formats all values appropriately using the math library

Submit your solution as a Jupyter Notebook with proper documentation. Include sample data and explain your approach.

Bonus: Add visualizations or additional features that might be useful for analyzing student performance data!
