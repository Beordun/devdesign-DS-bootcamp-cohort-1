# 1. Creates a text file called "numbers.txt"
# 2. Writes numbers 1 to 50, one per line
# 3. Reads the file back
# 4. Calculates and prints the sum of all numbers in the file

# Bonus tasks:
# - Allow the user to specify how many numbers to generate
# - Add error handling to your solution
# - Calculate other statistics (average, min, max)
